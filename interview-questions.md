# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Similarities

1. both deal with objects 
2. both have tests to check and better observe their code 
3. both can interact with user interface

Differences

1. ruby has gems and javascript uses node modules 
2. javascript interacts through the DOM, ruby interacts through libraries 
3. ruby tests through rspec files and gems, javascript tests through yarn and jest

Researched answer:
Both languages are interpreted as to be more flexible
both languages are object oriented so they can support manipulation of objects as well as encapsulation and inheritance
both are dynamic languages meaning they allow variables to hold certain values without specific declaration

Javascript is considered a front end dev tool while ruby is considered a back end dev tool
javascript is dynamically typed while ruby can also use static typing tools
Ruby is strictly an object oriented program while javascript also deals with object but is prototype based

2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: TDD stands for Test driven developement so testing code to see how things develope and eying changes or bugs

Researched answer:The philosophy of test writing, failing, then manipulating code that makes tests pass. Test driven development.  TDD Practice ensures the two pieces of code are sound.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: do and end, i want to say its like a method that can be checked by printing 

Researched answer: an anonymous function passed to a method to determine an outcome
